In the ethereal realm of Aetheria, legend speaks of the Crystal Castles, a floating citadel hidden amongst the clouds, holding the secrets to the arcane and the divine.  Ages ago, the Crystal Castles was guarded by the Celestial Order, a cadre of powerful mages who wielded the elemental Aether to maintain balance and harmony. 
However, a cataclysm known as the Fracture shattered this order, dispersing the Aether and leaving the land vulnerable to the creeping darkness from the Void. 
Your character, a young wanderer with an unknown past, awakens in a world teetering on the brink of chaos. Rumors speak of a rising darkness, of shadows creeping into the hearts of men and women, twisting them into beings of malice. Yet, in these troubled times, whispers of a prophecy echo through the land, a prophecy that foretells the arrival of a hero born of the lost Aether, destined to reunite the fractured shards and restore the Celestial Order. 
Your journey begins in the quaint village of Lumin, a beacon of hope in a world dimming under the shadow of the Void. Here, in the very heart of Aetheria, your path will unfold.
